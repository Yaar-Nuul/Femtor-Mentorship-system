      <h1>Review Of The Book <b style="color: rgb(7, 107, 146);">‘Born A Crime’</b> by <b>Trevor Noah</b></h1>
      <p>In the first two chapters of <b style="color: rgb(17, 40, 49);">‘Born A Crime’</b> by <b>Trevor Noah</b>, the author vividly recounts his childhood in apartheid South Africa. He describes the complexities of his identity as a mixed-race child born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, which was illegal under apartheid laws. Noah's storytelling is both humorous and saddening, offering insights into the harsh realities of growing up in a racially divided society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issues presented in these chapters relate with the struggles faced by many individuals in Africa including South Sudan. Like apartheid in South Africa, South Sudan has a history of ethnic conflict and division. The legacy of colonialism and ongoing political instability has resulted in deep-seated challenges in society, including discrimination, violence, and inequality.
      </p>

     <p> In the book, Trevor vividly describes the power struggle between the mojor tribes of South Africa, the <b>Xhosa</b> and the <b>Zulu</b>, fighting for leadership. It is relatable to the tribal wars between the <b>Nuer</b> and the <b>Dinka </b> communities in South Sudan, fighting for leadership who have been fighting for over for leadership seats since the S.P.L.M era in 1992.</p>

      <p>
        Trevor's story explores themes of determination, survival, and the strength of comedy in the face of hardship. These themes are visible among the people of my country, South Sudan as people's perseverance play a significant role in holding on to the hope of coming together and building one nation as a whole. They work to overcome obstacles and create a better future for themselves and their country
